Working Repo for VascTracX
- Currently correcting erroneous commit, for repo functionality (slightly older version, buggy scheduler integration for the onboarding survey) - build/add necessary pods within the pods folder (which can be pulled from AssignmentTwo) and delete the placeholder file, and delete the dummy file in Base.lproj

Features implemented:
- Onboarding survey (with scheduler + GCP)
- 6MWT (integrating with scheduler is WIP)
- Updated UI/UX
- HealthRecords permissions + HealthKit passive query integration
- New consent flow (new images, cards, and file sections added)
- User sign-ins (user/pwd or Google)

Work in Progress:
- SF12
- WIQ
- Useful graphs/dashboards for the user + to inform querying

Next Steps:
- ML Dev
