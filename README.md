Working Repo for VascTracX

Build instructions (Updated March 21):
- Currently correcting erroneous commit, for repo functionality (slightly older version, missing some UI/UX changes) - build/add necessary pods within the pods folder (which can be pulled from AssignmentTwo) and delete the placeholder file, and delete the dummy file in Base.lproj

Work in Progress:
- Additional useful graphs/dashboards for the user & physician + to inform querying
- Make WIQ Chart customized, more dynamic, and contained on a separate tab containing chart cards for patient viewing
- UI/UX Changes

Next Steps:
- ML Dev
